# Membrane_Switch
This is part of a college assignment: getting a 4x4 matrix keypad ("membrane switch") to work on a microcontroller.  
More precisely, on an... Olimex ARM-USB-OCD LPC2124...? I don't even know how to properly call this thing.

###Configuration###
- Pins 1.18 - 1.25 for the 4x4 matrix keypad pins
